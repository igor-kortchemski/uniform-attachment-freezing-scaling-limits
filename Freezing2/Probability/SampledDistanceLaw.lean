# Actual finite iid sampled-distance laws

The law is the pushforward of the full product probability measure by the
literal distance matrix. Repeated sampled points remain possible. Measured
isometries preserve the law, so it is defined on the source whole-space
measured-isometry quotient. On a fixed metric carrier it varies continuously
with the sampling probability measure.
