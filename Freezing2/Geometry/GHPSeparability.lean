# Separability of the whole-space GHP metric

Each measured isometry class has a representative, a finite net covering its
entire carrier, and the exact pushforward of its measure to that net. Rounded
distance and atomic-weight arrays form countably many codes. Equal codes
control the finite measured spaces and hence the original classes. This
constructs a countable basis for the existing GHP topology without discarding
zero-mass points or assuming a Polish-space result.
