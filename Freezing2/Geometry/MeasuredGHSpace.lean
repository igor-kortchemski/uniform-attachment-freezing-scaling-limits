# The GHP topology on measured isometry classes

The equivalence relation identifies the entire compact metric space by a
measure-preserving isometry, as in the source. The exact ambient-isometry GHP
infimum descends to this quotient and satisfies the pseudometric axioms.
Its topology and Borel structure are therefore available for weak convergence.
Separation, completeness, and separability are separate background results;
none is assumed in this construction or the deterministic-limit argument.
