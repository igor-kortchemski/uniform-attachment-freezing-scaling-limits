# Finite measured approximations in the exact GHP distance

A finite cover of the entire compact carrier gives a measurable finite-valued
map by testing its balls one at a time. Its pushforward supplies the finite
weights; no support or positivity condition on those weights is imposed.
The common ambient space is the original carrier, and both the Hausdorff and
Prokhorov contributions are bounded by the covering radius.
