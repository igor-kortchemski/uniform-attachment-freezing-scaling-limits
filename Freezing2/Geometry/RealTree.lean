# Real trees

A metric space is a **real tree** if any two points `s, t` are joined by a geodesic
segment, this segment is unique, and every injective continuous path from `s` to
`t` has the same image as the segment. This is the standard definition.

We prove that a complete metric space satisfying the four-point condition
(`0`-hyperbolicity) and having midpoints is a real tree:

* midpoints and completeness give geodesic segments (dyadic construction);
* the four-point condition forces their uniqueness, and characterizes their
  points as those `c` with `d(s,c) + d(c,t) = d(s,t)`;
* removing an interior point of the segment separates `s` from `t` (via the
  Gromov product at that point), so every path from `s` to `t` passes through every
  point of the segment, and injectivity forbids any other point.
